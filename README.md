# Self-Driving Car Simulator  

A browser-based self-driving car simulator built with JavaScript. This project demonstrates how neural networks can drive a car, avoid obstacles, and make decisions using real-time data. The simulation includes visualized network decision-making, lane detection, and traffic handling.

---

## Features  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Cars use neural networks for decision-making.  
- **Dynamic Traffic Simulation**: Avoid obstacles with dummy traffic cars.  
- **Visual Network**: The neural network's state is displayed for better understanding.  
- **Save and Load Models**: Save the best-performing car's brain and load it to see performance consistency.

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Self-Driving-Car-Simulator.git
   cd Self-Driving-Car-Simulator
Open index.html in your browser to run the simulation.
How It Works
The Neural Network decides the car's movements based on sensor input.
Traffic Cars serve as obstacles to avoid.
The Visualizer shows the neural network's decision-making process in real time.
Controls
Arrow Keys: Navigate the car (manual driving).
Neural network-based cars drive autonomously once trained.
